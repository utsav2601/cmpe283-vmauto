				<td><strong>VMware Java API</strong> - The Virtual Infrastructure (vSphere) Java API was initially created by Steve JIN who used to work at VMware R&amp;D with strong support/help from Sujit Panikatt, Rich Hogan, Marianna Tessel, Larry Jocobs, Jeff Hu, Carter Shanklin, Pablo Roesch, John Huang, Steve Herrod, Beng-Hong Lim, Colleen Lam, Krystia Przepiorski, Tom Elloit and etc. The API was open sourced at sourceforge.net under BSD license in May 2008. It's now in version 5.0. We expect more people to contribute this project along the way.</td>

			<!-- MongoDB --><tr>
				<td style="background-color:#4c3a2c"><span id="logomongodb"></span></td>
				<td><strong>MongoDB</strong> (from "humongous") is a cross-platform document-oriented database system. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.</td>

				<td style="background-color:#F8F3E4;"><span id="logoapache"></span></td>
				<td><strong>Apache Software Foundation</strong> - is a decentralized community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License and is therefore free and open source software (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a meritocracy, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation open-source organization, in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock-in.</td>

			<!-- jQuery --><tr>
				<td style="background-color:#b3d4fc;"><span id="logojquery"></span></td>
				<td><strong>jQuery</strong> - is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig. It is currently developed by a team of developers led by Dave Methvin. Used by over 80% of the 10,000 most visited websites, jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today. jQuery is free, open source software, licensed under the MIT License. jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications</td>

				<td><strong>Google Chart/Vizualization API</strong> - provides a perfect way to visualize data on your website. From simple line charts to complex hierarchical tree maps, the chart gallery provides a large number of ready-to-use chart types. The most common way to use Google Charts is with simple JavaScript that you embed in your web page. You load some Google Chart libraries, list the data to be charted, select options to customize your chart, and finally create a chart object with an id that you choose. Then, later in the web page, you create a &lt;div&gt; with that id to display the Google Chart.</td>
